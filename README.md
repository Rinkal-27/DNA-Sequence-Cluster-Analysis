# DNA Sequence Clustering and Visualization

## Overview

This project performs clustering and visualization of biological sequences using pairwise sequence alignment, multidimensional scaling (MDS), and K-means clustering. The primary objective is to group similar sequences and visualize their relationships in a lower-dimensional space.

## Features

Computes pairwise sequence alignment scores using Biopython.

Constructs a distance matrix based on alignment scores.

Uses multidimensional scaling (MDS) to reduce dimensionality.

Applies K-means clustering to group similar sequences.

Visualizes the clustered sequences using a 2D scatter plot.
